  summary: |-
    Product oriented front-end developer doubling as designer, I love to work
    around the stack and undertake big challenges end-to-end.

    I seek environments where testing and quality are valued, engineers do not
    shy away from finding creative and innovative solutions and aim at improving
    their workflow and automations as well as their product, where business
    requirements and elegance in execution matter equally.

      him to test, explore, and validate in the time it takes most engineers to brew
      the coffee. We're glad to have him contributing to the Kano Product and can fully

      honesty and a great sense of humor that turns out as an outstanding

      best assets of any endeavour that shoots for the greatest creative
      developers. I truly hope our career paths will cross again in the future.
