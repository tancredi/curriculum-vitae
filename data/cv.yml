  summary: |-
    Product oriented front-end developer doubling as designer, I love to work
    around the stack and undertake big challenges end-to-end.

    I seek environments where testing and quality are valued, engineers do not
    shy away from finding creative and innovative solutions and aim at improving
    their workflow and automations as well as their product, where business
    requirements and elegance in execution matter equally.
