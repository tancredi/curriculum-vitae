      "Tanc is a unique blend of a talented designer and an incredibly proficient
      software engineer. When I joined Lendable I was really impressed with the projects
      Tanc built. And when I say 'built' I mean he made beautiful graphic design,
      created maintainable software architecture, implemented it elegantly in the code,
      and put up a Continuous Integration pipeline. I don't know that many people who
      can do so many things and do them well. And did I tell you that he always thinks
      about the user and the product? Well, now you know! "
  - name: Livia van Strydonck
    reference:
      I've had the pleasure of working with Tanc at Lendable and at Kano across
      various different projects. He is a fantastic designer and a brilliant software
      engineer. I know I can rely on Tanc to deliver beautiful work, fast and with a
      lot of humour.
  - name: Riccardo Cocetta
    reference:
      "I worked with Tanc at Kano and YLD, and knowing him made me realise
      of the existence of a new breed of Front-End developers: he can think of amazing
      UI/UX and implement them himself with I speed and precision I couldn't imagine
      before. I have witnessed him excel both in one-man shows and in teams, where I
      could entrust him as a partner with high level objectives and rely that he would
      drive the team to deliver on those.  If I could, I would hire Tanc to work with
      me at any company ... but he doesn't always want to join. "

      'Tank is a talented creator, thrives on solving problems in creative
      ways through design and code. '
  - name: Tommy Säl
    reference:
      "Tancredi is a highly skilled, well spoken, easy to work with developer
      with a lot of hidden talents. At first glance you'd think that he spent years
      just perfecting his skills as a web developer, but once you've spent some time
      with him you'll realise hes a jack of all trades – and mastering most of them.\r\n\r\nI'd
      recommend Tanc to anyone who needs an eccentric (in a good way) developer with
      a lot of passion."
  - name: Mathew Keegan
    reference:
      Tanc is without a doubt one of the most talented and creative people
      I've ever met. He can work in any part of the stack, and single handedly created
      an entire social platform for Kano and released a fantastically addictive code
      drawing app that is loved by thousands.
  - name: Edward Cooke
    reference:
      "Tanc's an extremely gifted designer/developer, with a flair for producing
      beautiful things at speed. His skill and experience go far beyond his age. He's
      passionate, insightful and iconoclastic. All in all: a very talented young entrepreneur. "
  - name: Alex Klein
    reference:
      Tancredi Trugenberger is a one-off – a uniquely talented, thoughtful,
      and energetic technologist – by quality and sheer irrepressibility, he is in a
      league all his own. At Kano, Tanc brought an artist's eye to exceedingly difficult
      projects, all on short deadlines, and consistently wowed myself and his colleagues.
      He has extraordinary product instincts and a development approach that allows
      him to test, explore, and validate in the time it takes most engineers to brew
      the coffee. We're glad to have him contributing to the Kano Product and can fully
      endorse any of his outside ventures as well.
  - name: Adam Johnson
    reference:
      Tanc is a perfectionist and works tirelessly to ensure every pixel and
      interaction is in place. He often adds special flair to projects beyond the call
      of duty.
  - name: Kevin Rooney
    reference:
      "Tanc has an amazing skill set. Its rare to find someone with such a
      great ability and appreciation for Design but who can also make that design work
      with the coding side of things. \r\n\r\nTanc brings an amazing enthusiasm to projects,
      this just made me want to work harder and come up with more interesting things
      for him to build. I would work with Tanc again in a heart beat."
