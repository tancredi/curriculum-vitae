    summary: '
      While at YLD, I have been mainly working as on-site consultant at
      DAZN offices, where I transitioned from the
      YLD team to the inhouse team in order to support during a critical
      pre-launch phase.


      It has been exciting to embrace challenges related to an enterprise
      environment while involved with a large build
      and mission critical launch.


      At DAZN I have contributed estabilishing practices, built tooling to
      improve the development workflow and benchmark performance of the new
      build, held presentations to other teams and stakeholders and of course
      developed the core product, having the chance to deal with many
      moving parts of the organisation, from the inhouse teams and outsourcing
      teams to architects, business analysts and others.

    position: Front-End Developer
    startDate: '2017-09-30'
    summary: "
      In my first contract at Lendable I had to fully redesign / rebrand the
      platform and re-develop the front-end in separation from a new API,
      as the build at the time was a legacy MVP codebase.


      The rebuild had to cover all of the pre-existing functionality and
      introduce testing at both unit and end to end level, and assure a
      smooth, progressive launch that could have been A/B tested for
      performance against its predecessor other than for any potential
      production issues.


      Dealing with sensitive financial data and on a fairly large scale,
      this has been one of my biggest challenges, and it's been extremely
      rewarding to see tha platform not only launch with no major issues,
      but also to see it perform far better on its metrics than it
      previously did.


      Also, the platform is a fully isomorphic implementation built with a
      custom architecture, as at the time this project had started readily
      available frameworks such as Next.js were not mature enough to support
      its requirements.


      Having left enough documentation and held small workshops before the
      end of the contract, after I was gone the inhouse back-end team (mainly
      focused on PHP & Symphony) was able to maintain the front-end and build
      new features in indipendence.

    summary: "
      Starting at Kano as the 5th employee when the core product was in
      prototyping phase, I have taken the lead on web and built most of its
      public facing assets at the time, from the static website it launched
      with to the social platform that users shared and discussed creations on,
      inclusive of the main API used by both web platforms and Kano devices,
      to prototypes that became fully fledged educational games and apps on the
      operating system.


      In my time building all the web assets for Kano, the company had closed
      one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in education, won
      several awards (including two Webby Awards in different years) and secured
      several rounds of funding.


      Aside from the web, I had the chance of ideating and prototyping some of
      the educational products that have been continued in developement and are
      to this day and a fundamental part of the Kano OS and learning content
      ecosystem, including Make Art, Make Snake, Make Pong and others, using a
      range of different technologies.


      As the company grew, I've supported it through the hiring process while
      forming a web team and trained new staff members, then left the company
      sized over 60 employees dedicate myself full time to building
      Workshape.io, a side-project, into a company.

      Tanc built. And when I say 'built' I mean he made beautiful graphic design,
      created maintainable software architecture, implemented it elegantly in the code,
      and put up a Continuous Integration pipeline. I don't know that many people who
      can do so many things and do them well. And did I tell you that he always thinks

      projects, all on short deadlines, and consistently wowed myself and his colleagues.
      He has extraordinary product instincts and a development approach that allows
      him to test, explore, and validate in the time it takes most engineers to brew
      the coffee. We're glad to have him contributing to the Kano Product and can fully
      endorse any of his outside ventures as well.
